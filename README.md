# Luxembourgish-Russian and Bulgarian Dictionary projects

Based on [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/docs/) to build mobile apps in the future.

The main goal of this project is to build a searchable database of most of Luxembourgish words with Russian and/or Bulgarian translation.

Almost all of the Luxembourgish dictionaries have only French, German or English translations. We thrive to add Russian and Bulgarian to that list.

## Build on your machine

To build the project, you should have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. Then run `npm install` and `ionic serve`.

## Dictionary database

For now, Dictionary and a Phrasebook are stored in [src/assets/dictionary](./src/assets/dictionary/) folder.

## Participation
